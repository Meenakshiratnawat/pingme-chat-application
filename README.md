## Highlights

ðŸŒŸ **Tech stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) + Socket.IO + TailwindCSS + DaisyUI  
ðŸŽƒ **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login with JWT-based authentication and protected routes  
ðŸ‘¾ **Realtime messaging:** Instant chat powered by Socket.IO with persistent WebSocket connections  

**Core Realtime Features:**  
- **Online user status:** Display live "online" indicators for active users  
- **Who is typing:** Show typing indicators when the other user is typing  
- **Message delivery in realtime:** New messages instantly delivered across all active clients  
- **Contact requests:** Realtime contact request system â€” send, receive, and accept contact requests with instant feedback  
- **Contact request notifications:** When a contact request is sent, the target user receives an instant in-app notification via Socket.IO  
- **Realtime contact acceptance:** When a contact request is accepted, both users immediately see each other added to their contacts â€” no refresh required  
- **Read receipts:** Visual feedback showing if the recipient has read the message  
- **Error handling:** Implemented on both server and client sides to handle API errors, socket disconnects, and edge cases gracefully

## Architecture Overview

```
Frontend â†’ Socket.IO Client
Backend  â†’ Socket.IO Server
MongoDB  â†’ For persisting messages, contacts, and user data
```

**Flow:**  
- The client establishes a **Socket.IO connection** to the server after authentication  
- The server maintains a **userSocketMap** to track who is online  
- Events flow both ways to power realtime updates  

---

## Why Socket.IO

- Provides **bidirectional realtime communication**  
- Works reliably across browsers and network conditions  
- Handle reconnections automatically  
-  Support an **event-driven API** for chat events like `newMessage`, `typing`, `messages-read`, `contact-accept`  
- Works on top of WebSockets with minimal setup.
